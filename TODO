+ Add microwin

BSPs
====
+ We need a generic constant like "POINTING DRIVER".

+ BSPs need to have a #define that indicates they have a pointing driver.

svgalib
=======
+ Must configure /dev/null in application
+ Must add /dev/mem and configure it in application (or find config option)
+ May want to add SVGALIB_CONFIG_FILE

Nano-X
======
+ Fix message "Error opening /dev/fb0: m" on BSPs (e.g. sis) which
  do not have framebuffer device

+ check if we want to use "non-default" swap routines (include/swap.h)

+ Clean up rtems_init.c when the BSPs make known their graphics/pointing
  capabilities.

+ Remove hack in microwin/src/drivers/vgaplan4.h and make outb/outw
  more generic -- like weak symbols or something with default implementations
  on non-x86 architectures.
